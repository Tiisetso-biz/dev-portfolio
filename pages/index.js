      <h3>My Introduction as a developer</h3>
      <p>
        My name is Tiisetso Tebele. I'm born and bred in Limpopo but currently
        based in Johannesburg. I like to think of myself as an ambitious person,
        enthusiastic about learning, driven and definitely passionate about
        software development. Studied Computer Science
        and Informatics at University of Johannesburg. Started programming back in 2018. And throughout the years I've
        been doing group and personal projects of which I trust qualify me for
        being one of the resilient individuals. I mean Iâ€™ve managed to move
        right along with others and our projects were a success. In my free time
        I just watch football matches, or just watch random videos online. I
        often just go out for a walk just to ease myself off.
